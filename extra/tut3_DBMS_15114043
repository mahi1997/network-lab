ANSWER 2:
select Distinct PID,Name,count(Distinct MID) 
from Person as A natural join M_Cast natural join Movie  
group by PID,year having count(Distinct MID) >=  all( select count(Distinct MID) 
from Person as B natural join M_Cast natural join Movie where A.PID=B.PID group by year ) ;

select PID,Name,max(year)-min(year) 
from Person natural join M_Cast natural join Movie 
group by PID having max(year)-min(year) >=all(select max(year)-min(year) 
from Person natural join M_Cast natural join Movie group by PID);


ANSWER 4:
select PID, Name from Person where PID not in(select distinct(PID) from M_Cast as C1 natural join Movie as M1  where exists(select MID  from M_Cast as C2 natural join Movie as M2 where C1.PID = C2.PID and (M2.year - 3) > M1.year and not exists(select MID from M_Cast as C3 natural join Movie as M3 where C1.PID = C3.PID and M1.year < M3.year and M3.year < M2.year)));


ANSWER 5: 
select Distinct A.PID,A.Name 
from Person as A natural join M_Cast, Person as B natural join M_Director
where M_Cast.MID = M_Director.MID and B.Name ='Rishi Kapoor' 
group by A.PID having count(Distinct M_Cast.MID)>all(Select count(Distinct M_Cast.MID) 
from Person as C natural join M_Cast, Person as D natural join M_Director 
where M_Cast.MID=M_Director.MID and D.Name<>'Rishi Kapoor' and A.PID=C.PID group by C.PID,D.PID );

ANSWER 6: 
select A.title 
from Movie as A natural join  (select year,avg(rating) as avg_rating from Movie  group by Year ) as D
where A.year=D.year and A.rating> 2*D.avg_rating;

ANSWER 7:

select T1.year 
from Movie as T1 
group by T1.year 
having sum(rating)>2*(select avg(rating) 
from Movie as B 
where T1.year=B.year 
group by B.year);



ANSWER 8:
select MID,Title 
from Movie 
where rating in (select * from(select distinct rating 
from Movie 
order by rating desc limit 100) as T);


-----Note: We can not use limit directly like select MID,title from Movie order by rating desc limit 100 
b'coz it will give only 100 movies but 100th movie can have 50th rank in rating if or may be 95th too. At any position there can be one or more Movie.
